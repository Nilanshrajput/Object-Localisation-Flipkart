# Object_Localisation_Flipkart
This repo deals with object localisation problem statement in FlipkartGrid contest.
We used MobileNet. However, a great accuracy wasn't achieved on this dataset. Probably, if you want to go ahead with such a problem, data augmentation might be an addition to the final accuracy.
Some of the code is inspired from: https://github.com/lars76/object-localization
